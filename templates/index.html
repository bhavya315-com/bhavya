    <h1>The Vanishing Coastal Tribe</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      Along the shifting coastlines of our world, a tribe once lived in harmony with the sea.
      Today, rising tides and erosion are slowly washing away their land â€” and with it, their history.

They belong to the cetacean family, which also includes whales and porpoises. Known for their playful and curious behavior, dolphins have fascinated humans for centuries and are often seen leaping from the water, swimming alongside boats, or performing acrobatics. Their friendly nature has earned them a place in the folklore of many coastal cultures, where they are seen as protectors or messengers of the sea."},
